# 👋 Hi, I'm Lateef Salako

### 🚀 DevOps Engineer | Cloud Strategist | AWS | Azure | GCP | Kubernetes | Terraform | CI/CD Architect

I'm a **DevOps Engineer** with over **5 years of hands-on experience** architecting **secure, scalable, and cost-optimized infrastructure** in the cloud. I specialize in **AWS**, **Kubernetes**, and **Terraform**, with a strong focus on aligning engineering workflows with **business goals**.

My mission is to **empower teams** by designing resilient systems, accelerating time-to-market through automation, and building DevOps strategies that **drive measurable impact** from reducing downtime to improving developer productivity.

### 🧠 DevOps Philosophy

> _"Automation is best when it empowers people, not replaces them."_  
> _— Salako Lateef_

I believe DevOps isn't just about tooling—it's a **strategic enabler** for growth, speed, and resilience. I advocate for a DevOps culture that prioritizes **collaboration**, **clarity**, and **continuous learning**.
